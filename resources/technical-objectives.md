## Technical Learning Objectives

The following learning objectives must be included in your project. You should review this document as you are designing the project to ensure that your project includes all of the objectives. When we wrap up the project in a few weeks you'll come back to this document and fill it out as part of your reflection/retrospective process.

### API Design

**Design an API to meet the needs of your application.** Provide a link to the definition for your endpoints (can be code/configuration, or can be documentation). List one thing that your team learned about designing a good API.

*Endpoint definition location:* https://github.com/nss-se-cohort-3/u5-midstone-mint-chip/blob/main/resources/mint-chip-api-definition.yaml

*What we learned:* Consistency in naming conventions and structures can prevent problems later in the development 
process and makes the bigger picture easier to understand and learn 

**Develop a service endpoint definition that uses complex inputs and outputs.** Select one of your endpoints and list the operationâ€™s input and output objects. Under each, list its attributes.

*Endpoint:* /digitalPantry (Create a new digital pantry):

*Input object(s):* (Request Body)

* pantryName (string)
  
* userId (string)

*Output object(s):* (Response Body)

* pantryName (string)
* pantryId (string)
* userId (string)
* inventory (array of items)


**Given a user story that requires a user to provide values to a service endpoint, design a service endpoint including inputs, outputs, and errors.** Select one of your endpoints that accepts input values from a client. List the error cases you identified and how the service responds in each case. Provide at most 3 error cases.

| **Endpoint:**     digitalPantry |                                |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Error case**                  | **Service response**           |
|                                 |                                |
| if a pantryId cannot be found   | throws PantryNotFoundException |
|                                 |                                |

**Develop a service endpoint definition that uses query parameters to determine how results are sorted or filtered.** List at least one endpoint that allows sorting or filtering of results. Which attribute(s) can be sorted/filtered on?

*Endpoint:*   /recipes:get:
getRecipeList (RecipeDao)

*Attribute(s):* HashKey: recipeId;
RangeKey: recipeName

**Determine whether a given error condition should result in a client or server exception.** List one client exception and one server exception that your service code throws. List one condition in which this exception is thrown.

|                       | **Exception**                | **One case in which it is thrown**              |
|---	                |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|**Client exception:**  | 	    PantryNotFoundException | 	     when calling getPantry and pantry is null |
|**Service exception:** | 	                            | 	                                               |

### DynamoDB Table Design

**Decompose a given set of use cases into a set of DynamoDB tables that provides efficient data access.** List the DynamoDB tables in your project:

1. Pantries
2. Recipes
3. Meal Plans


**Design a DynamoDB table key schema that allows items to be uniquely identified.** Describe the primary key structure for your DynamoDB table with the most interesting primary key. In a sentence or two, explain your choice of partition/sort key(s).

-    DigitalPantriesTable:
     
* AttributeName: "userId"
     KeyType: "HASH"
* AttributeName: "pantryId"
     KeyType: "RANGE"

* Using this key schema we allows us to get a set of pantries for a user (userId - Hash) and then get a specific pantry from that set (pantryId - Range)
     

**Design the attributes of a DynamoDB table given a set of use cases.** List a DynamoDB table with at least 3 attributes. List one relevant use case that uses the attribute. In one sentence, describe why the attribute is included.

**Table name:** DigitalPantriesTable

**Attributes:** userId, pantryId, inventory, pantryName

| Attribute name   | (One) relevant use case            | attribute purpose                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| userId           | calls a list of pantries by userId | needed to return a user's pantries as a HashKey                       |
| pantryId         | calls a pantry by pantryId         | needed to return a pantry from a user's set of pantries as a RangeKey |
| inventory        | returns the inventory of a pantry  | needed to display inventory                                           |
|                  |                                    |                                                                       |
|                  |                                    |                                                                       |

### DynamoDB Indexes

**Design a GSI key schema and attribute projection that optimizes queries not supported by a provided DynamoDB table.** In one or two sentences, explain why you created one of the GSIs that your project uses, including one use case that uses that index.

**Table name:** RecipesTable

**Table keys:** recipeId (HashKey)

**GSI keys:** recipeRegion (HashKey)

**Use case for GSI:** to sort recipes by region

**Implement functionality that uses query() to retrieve items from a provided DynamoDB's GSI.** List one of your use cases that uses `query()` on a GSI.

**Table name:** RecipesTable

**Use case for `query()` on GDI:** As a MCDP customer, I would like to filter recipes by region.

## Soft(er) Outcomes

**Learn a new technology.** For each team member, list something new that that team member learned:

| Name     | Something new the team member learned             |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Brecghan |                                                   |
| Jonathan | front end                                         |
| Richard  |                                                   |
| Mark     | Swagger (useful for mapping out tables structure) |

**Identify key words to research to accomplish a technical goal. Use sources like Stack Overflow to solve issues encountered while programming.** Give an example of a search term that your team might have used to find an answer to a technical question/obstacle that your team ran into. List the resource that you found that was helpful.

**Search terms:** "You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file"

**Helpful resource:** Stack Overflow

**Find material online to learn new technical topics.** List one resource that your team found on your own that helped you on your project.

**Topic:** HTML Element Reference


**Resource:** W3 Schools

**Participate in a design review to receive feedback on your design.** List one change or clarification that your team made after holding a review of your design (either from a peer or instructor). (If there are comments/questions still in the design doc, that might save you some time remembering...)

1. After presenting to our sister-team we added more specific endpoints for each specific use case

**Participate in a design review to give feedback on another group's design.** List one question or piece of feedback that you remember giving the other team at the time of their review that was helpful or insightful. (If there are comments/questions still in the design doc, that might save you some time remembering...)

1. We suggested they implement a GSI

**Share what was worked on yesterday, the plan for today, and any blockers as a part of a scrum standup.** In one or two sentences, describe what your team found to be the most useful outcome from holding daily standups.

1. We debugged what wasn't working. We were able to maintain a clear attack plan for our backlog tickets
